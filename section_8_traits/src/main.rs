/*

Traits expand on the flexibility we have when we use structures.
    - Similar to OOP interfaces
    - Defines what we can do with our structures

Topics:
    - Generics                  (different parameters, same function)
    - dyn                       (keyword to allow dynamic types at runtime)
    - Operator overloading
    - Static dispatch
    - Dynamic dispatch

    println!("Hello, world!");
